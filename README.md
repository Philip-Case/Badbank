# Bad Bank App for MIT XPro Full-Stack Developer Class May 2022

## What Is It?
For this MITxPro Coding Bootcamp challenge, we were asked to create a banking app that allows the user to create an account, deposit and withdraw money, and keep track of the data. 

## How To Use It
Visit my [BadBankApp](http://philipcasebankapp.s3.amazonaws.com//index.html). Select `Create Account` and create a profile with a username, email, and password. Next, you may create another account or make a deposit or withdrawal. If you choose to make a deposit or withdrawal, you must input a valid number. Each deposit and withdrawal is saved in the transaction data. If you choose to create a new account, the previous user and their transaction data is replaced with the new user.

## What I Found Challenging
It was an initial challenge to get the S3 bucket permissions set properly.

## Extras
Adding a calculator was inspired by ideas from other students in my class.
